## [About]({{page.title}})

I'm a software engineer by day (and also sometimes by night). When I'm not
writing code, I'm usually having breakfast, play basketball or watch TV shows.
Shoot me an email at anything@unwiredcouch.com if you want so say "Hi".

I try hard to check all the links I post here, but since the destination sites are
